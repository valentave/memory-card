# Memory Cards Game

Welcome to the Memory Cards Game, a fun and challenging React-based web application. Test your memory and cognitive skills by matching pairs of cards while making sure you never select the same card twice. The game offers three different difficulty levels to suit your preference and skill level.

## How to play

1. Start by selecting your preferred difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Each level comes with a different number of cards to manage.
2. Click on any card. Remember the image you see, as you'll need to avoid selecting it again.
3. Now, click on another card. Ensure you do not select a card you've already chosen. If you choose a card you've seen before, you lose the game.
4. Keep selecting cards without repeating any until you've successfully selected all the unique cards to win the game.

## Difficulty Levels

- Easy: 5 unique cards
- Medium: 10 unique cards
- Hard: 20 unique cards

## Technologies Used

- Javascript + React for implementing the game logic and interactivity.
- HTML + CSS for structuring and styling the web page.
